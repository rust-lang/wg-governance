# Pre-RFC Process RFC

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC introduces a pre-RFC process prior to submitting a formal RFC.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Navigating the current RFC process can be very intimidating, especially for newer community members. It is very discouraging for someone to spend a lot of time and effort on creating an RFC, then seeing it get rejected quickly for a reason that would have been clear if they had talked to someone on the relevant team first. There is little sense in writing a full, formal RFC without bringing a team member onboard first. The intent of this pre-RFC process is to help produce higher quality and more relevant RFCs that are more likely to be accepted. 

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

This RFC introduces two roles:
* **shepherd** - (add more here)
* **liason** - this is a member of the team most relevant to the proposed change. This person should be called in as needed to work with the person composing the RFC, give feedback, and provide guidance throughout the pre-RFC process.

## Pre-RFC Process

### Step 1: Start the conversation
* Open a new discussion topic on the [Rust internals forum](https://internals.rust-lang.org/).
* The topic should start with "[Pre-RFC]"
* [Example of a pre-RFC post](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-platformfrom-and-platforminto/12033/3).

### Step 2: Find a Shepherd and Liason
* how? Asking for one in the thread?

### Step 3: Draft an RFC in the forum thread
* template?

### Step 4: Create the formal RFC
* link to pre-RFC thread
