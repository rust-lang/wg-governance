# Pre-RFC process

## Motivations and Reasons
* navigating the RFC process can be intimidating
* makes it more likely for the eventual RFC to be accepted
* we often get RFCs "out of the blue"
* it would be better to clarify the ideas that are "moving forward" ideas that are "speculative"
* no sense in spending the time writing a full, formal RFC without the idea that somebody on the team is into the idea


## Process
* Start with an open issue and an internals thread
* If someone is interested in idea or team wants to pick it up, "liason" gets involved in the discussion and works with the people pushing the idea
* First step to opening an RFC is to get enother team member on board
* Then team member works with you
* And you are the "shepherd" of the proposal
* People should at most be the liason on 2 or 3 things at a time

### Roles
* **shepherds** - the ones "in the trenches", summarizing conversations, driving the design
* **liason** is called in as needed to help out, having meetings **with the shepherd** to give feedback and possibly raising things in the design meeting

## Questions
