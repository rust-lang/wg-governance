# Governance WG meeting 2020.01.14

## Discussion topic: Project groups description RFC, Review Dec 3 action items

Goal: Finalize discussion project groups description RFC 

## Background material

* Process for future meetings for 2020 is putting agendas and notes in this HackMD (https://hackmd.io/ATj1rZJaRimaIfIWfAOYfQ?edit) and
then posting minutes to https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/tree/project-wg-rfc/minutes and then doing the blog post
* Informal notes from last week https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/informal-2020.01.07.md

## Discussion agenda

* (Completed) Finalize discussion project groups description RFC 
https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/project-wg-rfc-next/draft-rfcs/working-group-terminology.md
* (Deferred) Review action items from meeting of December 3 2019 https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-governance/blob/master/minutes/2019.12.03.md#action-items

## Minutes

* Decision for specifics of working group creation is to remain with what was described in https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/enabling-the-formation-of-new-working-groups/10218
*Add flowchart to RFC to make project lifecycle more understandable
    (note to phase 1 in flowchart draft below, Lang team was trying to put some structure to this -- get a copy of relevant notes?)
*Sidebar: Tension between making RFC process lighter vs not providing enough structure
    FCP slowing things down
    Process as originally envisioned was create checklist and team checks box and goes into FCP for 10 days because ?always includes a weekend
    The box ticking was to be fast, but now people don't tick boxes for weeks or months by time get to FCP for RFC people already have done this step
    Then FCP feels redundant
    How address problems with RFC process? Out of scope of project groups RFC
    We would prefer to centralize team procedures in one process but we are aware that RFC process is currently too heavyweight 
*Proposal of potential "Suspended" status in between Active and Archived
    Concern that discussion related to "Suspended" projects could get lost, would be more likely to be responded to and continue if moved to Internals
    Therefore no "Suspended" status, just Archived
*Discussion of why projects end took place and included in flowchart

*Group Statuses:
- Active
- Archived

*Future work:
- Lighten RFC process

FLOWCHART

1. Initial work:
    * Discuss the problem area, come up with a concrete charter and some notes on possible solutions
    * Find a liaison from the team who is excited and willing to help
    * One common way to do this:
        * Open internals thread for wider discussion
        * Ping specific folks from the relevant team
2. Obtain consensus to create project group
    * Specify liaison, proposed shepherds, etc
    * Each team might do this slightly differently:
        * could be a meeting and noted in notes
        * could be an RFC, which 
3. Create group repository, zulip/discord streams, team on github repo, etc
    * or unarchive if this is re-activating an archived group
5. Group does their work
    * This may include follow-up RFCs with final designs
6. When active work stops, group becomes "archived"
    * Archived is not a permanent/immutable state.
    * Reasons to stop:
        * nobody has time or higher priority things arose
        * some blocking issue that can't be resolved
        * don't see additional work to do on this
        * work was done to a satisfactory state
        * decided the idea wasn't so good after all
7. Create a blog post. Scope may vary but ideally it would include:
    * Overview of decisions, RFCs, and other output
    * Thoughts on how the process worked, difficulties encountered, etc.
8. Archive repository and chat channel
    * Can re-open a archived working group if:
        * have shepherd, liaison
        * have team consensus
            * if a lot of time has passed, part of this should be evaluating whether previous decisions have "bitrotted" or whether they still apply.
    * Re-open "goto step 2"

-->From 7 can circle back to 2
